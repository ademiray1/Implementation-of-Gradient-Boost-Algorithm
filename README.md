**Description**
This notebook demonstrates step by step process of how to build gradient boost model and how to improve the model.

**Additional Information**

If you want to tune your hyper parameter with more inputs then the space and time complexity will be high. In addition we do not know that for which data what hyper parameters input we should give for tuning also. So we have to try with different combinations come to the best parameter pair.
